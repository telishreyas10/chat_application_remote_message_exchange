# A Chat Application for Remote Message Exchange

A simple chat application for message exchange among remote peers using node and socket programming.

## Functionality of this program

When launched, the program should work like a UNIX shell. It should accept incoming connections and at the same time provide a user interface that will offer the following command options: (Note that specific
examples are used for clarity.)
1. help 
Display information about the available user interface options or command manual.

2. myip 
Display the IP address of this process.
Note: The IP should not be your “Local” address (127.0.0.1). It should be the actual IP of the computer.

3. myport Display the port on which this process is listening for incoming connections.

4. connect <destination> <port no> : 
This command establishes a new TCP connection to the specified <destination> at the specified < port no>. 

The <destination> is the IP address of the computer. Any attempt
to connect to an invalid IP should be rejected and suitable error message should be displayed. Success or
failure in connections between two peers should be indicated by both the peers using suitable messages.
Self-connections and duplicate connections should be flagged with suitable error messages.

5. list 
Display a numbered list of all the connections this process is part of. This numbered list will include
connections initiated by this process and connections initiated by other processes. The output should
display the IP address and the listening port of all the peers the process is connected to.

E.g., 
| id | IP Address      | Port No. |
|----|-----------------|----------|
| 1  | 192.168.21.20   | 4545     |
| 2  | 192.168.21.21   | 5454     |
| 3  | 192.168.21.23   | 5000     |
| 4  | 192.168.21.24   | 5000     |

6. terminate <connection id.> 

This command will terminate the connection listed under the specified
number when LIST is used to display all connections. E.g., terminate 2. In this example, the connection
with 192.168.21.21 should end. An error message is displayed if a valid connection does not exist as
number 2. If a remote machine terminates one of your connections, you should also display a message.

7. send <connection id.> <message> 
(For example, send 3 Oh! This project is a piece of cake). This will
send the message to the host on the connection that is designated by the number 3 when command “list” is
used. The message to be sent can be up-to 100 characters long, including blank spaces. On successfully
executing the command, the sender should display “Message sent to <connection id>” on the screen. On
receiving any message from the peer, the receiver should display the received message along with the
sender information.
(Eg. If a process on 192.168.21.20 sends a message to a process on 192.168.21.21 then the output on
192.168.21.21 when receiving a message should display as shown:
Message received from 192.168.21.20
Sender’s Port: <The port no. of the sender>
Message: “<received message>”

8. exit 

Close all connections and terminate this process. The other peers should also update their connection
list by removing the peer that exits
